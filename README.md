# ASHABB Tesla Car walkthrough - React Three Fiber

### This project utilizes Next.js and React Three Fiber to render and interact with 3D models on the web. The application features smooth scroll-based animations using ScrollControls and OrbitControls, making it responsive across devices. The 3D models are loaded using GLTF, and the UI is styled with TailwindCSS. Deployed on Vercel, the project showcases modern frontend development techniques with an emphasis on performance, responsiveness, and user interaction.
